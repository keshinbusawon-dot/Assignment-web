      <p><h3>Types of cancer</h3></p>
      <p>Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related conditions that occur when abnormal cells in the body grow uncontrollably and can spread to other parts of the body. Each type of cancer begins in a specific tissue or organ and behaves differently depending on where it starts, how fast it grows, and how it responds to treatment.
        Understanding the different types of cancer helps doctors, patients, and caregivers identify the right diagnosis, choose effective treatment plans, and improve overall outcomes. The most common categories include carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas, and melanomas â€” each affecting different parts of the body such as the skin, blood, bones, or internal organs.
        By learning about the various types of cancer, we can increase awareness, promote early detection, and support better prevention and treatment efforts</p>
