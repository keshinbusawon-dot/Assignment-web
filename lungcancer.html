      <p><h1 class="title1">Lung cancer</h1></p>
      <p><h3 class="title2">Lung cancer is a kind of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the lungs. The lungs are two spongy organs in the chest that control breathing.
        Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
        People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes smoked. Quitting smoking, even after smoking for many years, significantly lowers the chances of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer also can happen in people who have never smoked</h3></p>

        <p><h1 class="title3">Symptoms</h1></p>
        <p><h3 class="title4">In its early stages, lung cancer may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the disease progresses, the following signs often appear:
            	Persistent cough that doesn’t go away or worsens over time,
            	Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing,
            	Shortness of breath or wheezing,
            	Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm),
            	Hoarseness or changes in voice,
            	Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite,
            	Fatigue or feeling weak,
            	Recurring infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia,
        
        If any of these symptoms persist, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation.

            <p><h1 class="title5">Causes</h1></p>


            <p><h3 class="title6">Lung cancer develops when cells in the lungs grow uncontrollably due to DNA damage. Several risk factors increase the likelihood of this happening, including:
                	Smoking — The leading cause of lung cancer. Tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals that damage lung cells,
                	Secondhand smoke — Regular exposure to others’ cigarette smoke can also increase risk,
                	Exposure to radon gas — A naturally occurring radioactive gas found in some buildings,
                	Air pollution — Long-term exposure to polluted air can contribute to lung cancer,
                	Workplace exposure — Contact with asbestos, arsenic, and other carcinogens,
                	Family history — Having close relatives with lung cancer can increase the risk.

            <p><h3 class="title2">Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue.

                After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. But breast cancer doesn't just happen in women. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer.
                Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing. And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down. Much of this is due to the widespread support for breast cancer awareness and funding for research.

                Common signs and symptoms of breast cancer include:
                	A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area,
                	Changes in breast size or shape,
                	Dimpling or puckering of the breast skin,
                	Nipple discharge, especially if it’s bloody or clear,
                	Pain in any area of the breast,
                	Redness or scaling of the nipple or breast skin,
            
                    If any of these symptoms are noticed, medical advice should be sought immediately for proper evaluation and screening.

                    	Radiation exposure to the chest area
                
                These factors may contribute to abnormal changes in breast cells, leading them to multiply uncontrollably.

                <p><h3 class="title2">Bladder cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells lining the inside of the bladder — 
                    the organ responsible for storing urine. Most bladder cancers start in the urothelial cells (also known as transitional cells), which line the bladder’s inner wall. 
                    It is more common in older adults and can often be detected early, as it frequently causes noticeable symptoms such as blood in the urine

                  <p><h1 class="title3">Symptoms</h1></p>
                  <p><h3 class="title4">
                    Common symptoms of bladder cancer include:
	             	Blood in the urine (hematuria) — may cause urine to appear pink, red, or brown,
		            Frequent urination or an urgent need to urinate,
		            Pain or burning sensation during urination,
		            Lower back pain (especially on one side),
		            Pelvic pain or discomfort.

                    These symptoms may resemble other urinary conditions, so medical evaluation is important for accurate diagnosis and early treatment..

                        <p><h3 class="title2">Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells, usually caused by damage to the DNA of skin cells from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It most commonly develops on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, neck, arms, and legs, but it can also occur on areas not usually exposed.
                            There are three main types of skin cancer:
                                    Basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
                                    Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),
                                    Melanoma — the most serious form that can spread to other parts of the body.

                            Skin cancer can appear in many forms, but common signs include:
                            New growths or sores that don’t heal,
                            Changes in existing moles, such as irregular borders, uneven colors, or size increase,
                            A mole or spot that bleeds or becomes crusty,
                            Red, scaly, or rough patches on the skin,
                            A shiny or pearly bump (common in basal cell carcinoma),
                            Dark lesions under fingernails, toenails, or on mucous membranes (common in melanoma).
    
                            If detected early, most skin cancers are highly treatable, so regular skin checks and sun protection are essential.

                                The main cause of skin cancer is prolonged exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds. However, other risk factors include:
                                        Excessive sun exposure without protection (especially during peak hours),
                                        Fair skin tone or light hair, which has less natural melanin protection,

                            <p><h3 class="title2">Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the colon or rectum, which are parts of the large intestine. 
                                It usually starts as small, noncancerous growths called polyps that form on the inner walls of the colon or rectum. Over time, some of these polyps may become cancerous if not detected and removed early.
                                It is one of the most common cancers worldwide but also one of the most preventable and treatable when found in its early stages.

The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not always known, but it often develops when genetic mutations cause healthy cells in the colon or rectum to grow uncontrollably.
Common risk factors include:
Age — most cases occur in people over 50,
Family history of colorectal cancer or polyps,
Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis,
Low-fiber, high-fat diet or diets high in processed meats,
Lack of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle,
Obesity or being overweight,
Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption.

These factors can damage intestinal cells and increase the risk of cancer development.

    <p><h3 class="title2">Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, where blood cells are produced.
        It happens when the body creates abnormal white blood cells (leukocytes) that don’t function properly.

            Previous chemotherapy or radiation treatment for other cancers, a family history of blood cancers, and smoking can also increase the likelihood of developing leukemia.
